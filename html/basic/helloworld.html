        So whatever

      This is a paragraph element and this <b>bold</b> inside the paragraph. But
      <b>bold</b> is an old HTML element and it doesn't have a so called
      semantic meaning. And that's why we should use
      <strong>'strong'</strong> element. And this is <i>italic</i> using the 'i'
      element and here also we should 'em' for emphasize for
      <em>italics.</em> This is <mark>marked.</mark> And this is
      <small>small</small>, whereas, This is <delete>deleted.</delete> And this
      is <insert>inserted.</insert> This is <sub>subscript.</sub> And this is
      <sup>superscript</sup>.

    <ul>
      <li>
