    <!-- heading element.-->
    <!--Each and every page should have only one h1 heading.-->
    <!--Elements give structure to the webpage. Makes everything organized.-->
    <h1>The basic language of the web: HTML</h1>
    <h2>This is heading 2.</h2>
    <h3>This is heading 3.</h3>
    <h4>This is heading 4.</h4>
    <h5>This is heading 5.</h5>
    <h6>This is heading 6.</h6>
    <h7>Heading 7 does not exist.</h7>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph element and this <b>bold</b> inside the paragraph. But
      <b>bold</b> is an old HTML element and it doesn't have a so called
      semantic meaning. And that's why we should use
      <strong>'strong'</strong> element. And this is <i>italic</i> using the 'i'
      element and here also we should 'em' for emphasize for <em>italics.</em>

    <p>Okay let's talk about Ordered lists:</p>
    <ol>
      <!-- ol = Ordered list-->
      <!-- li = list item-->
      <li>One</li>
      <li>Two</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Let's talk about unordered lists:</p>
    <ul>
      <!-- ul = unordered list-->
      <li>Namaste</li>
      <li>Hello</li>
      <li>Hola</li>
      <li>Salam</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
