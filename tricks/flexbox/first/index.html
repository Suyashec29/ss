    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-items item-1">item-1</div>
      <div class="flex-items item-2">item-2</div>
      <div class="flex-items item-3">item-3</div>

      Let's say this is a grey container and it has child element having maroon
      color. Now if we use 'display:flex' in parent container then it'll become
      a flexbox containing flex-items. These flex items by default will have
      height same as the parent(grey container) i.e. their 'height:100%'. Now if
      you want to change this default behavior, you can enclose these flex items
      into a div element, now the child element will have the dimension
      depending on the type of element, but those div element will now be the
      flex-items (not maroon colored elements). This problem can also be solved
      by using align-items property (set align-items to any value)
    </p>

      However on setting 'flex-direction' to 'column', the problem arises again,
      but this time the width flex-item is equal to the width of parent i.e.
      'width:100%' and this time we cannot simply solve the problem by enclosing
      those flex-items into a div element. This problem can be solved by
      enclosing those flex items in div blocks and then set display of
      flex-items(maroon) to inline or block. This problem can also be solved by
      using align-items property (set align-items to any value).
