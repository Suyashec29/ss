We can also use transform: skewY(-7deg); instead of clip-path and then use
skewY(+7deg) on child elements.

 When we express a length measurement in percentages, like height, a padding, 
 a margin, or something else, the reference is always the parent element's width.

Percentages are measured relative to their parent’s font-size, if used to specify font-size;
Percentages are measured relative to their parent’s width, if used to specify lengths; 
em are measured relative to their parent font-size, if used to specify font-size; 
em are measured relative to the current font-size, if used to specify lengths;
rem are always measured relative to the document’s root font-size;
vh and vw are simply percentage measurements of the viewport’s height and width.

The computed value of a property is what gets inherited, not the declared value. 
Inheritance of a property only works if no one declares a value for that property. 
The inherit keyword forces inheritance on a certain property.
The initial keyword resets a property to its initial value.
