We can also use transform: skewY(-7deg); instead of clip-path and then use
skewY(+7deg) on child elements.

 When we express a length measurement in percentages, like height, a padding, 
 a margin, or something else, the reference is always the parent element's width.

Percentages are measured relative to their parent’s font-size, if used to specify font-size;
Percentages are measured relative to their parent’s width, if used to specify lengths; 
em are measured relative to their parent font-size, if used to specify font-size; 
em are measured relative to the current font-size, if used to specify lengths;
rem are always measured relative to the document’s root font-size;
vh and vw are simply percentage measurements of the viewport’s height and width.

The computed value of a property is what gets inherited, not the declared value. 
Inheritance of a property only works if no one declares a value for that property. 
The inherit keyword forces inheritance on a certain property.
The initial keyword resets a property to its initial value.

You cannot put 'background-size' or 'background-position' before the url of 
image(in background property) in css.

If you want to put special effects on a picture it's better to implement that
picture in css than in html.

Don't forget the filter property. It has many usefull properties.

We can fix the transition glitch by setting backface-visibility to hidden.

clip-path property takes care of overflow hidden, if we would have set
border-radius to 50% on the box containing the image then we would also have
to set overflow property to hidden, but instead of using border-radius if we
used clip-path property then we don't need to use overflow property.

object-fit property is similar to background-size property but instead 
object-fit property plays with html element, whereas background-size property
works on css properties like background or background-image. 



CSS :invalid child property is useful for forms, It is good when you are trying 
to show that the entry in the form is invalid.

new css property :placeholder-shown is a property that comes in use when the 
placeholder is shown. That is when the user is not tying anything in the form.

adjacent sibling selector (combinator) in css "+"
syntax: Parent firstSibling + secondSibling {} - to select the secondSibling

if we set opacity to 0 but not set visibility to hidden then element will still
be on the page and only it's opacity will be gone.
