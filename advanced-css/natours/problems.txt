  - compostion
    - on setting the position of images to absolute they'll disappear.
      Because I was using the max-width property on flex-items containing 
      those images which set the min width to 0. To fix this problem I used 
      width instead of max-width.
      
    - total width of all flex-items was 100% therefore the setting
      justify-content to space-evenly didn't work. There should be some extra
      space availabe in order for space-evenly to work propery. Therefore, I 
      made sure that total width of flex-items totals to 80-90 perecent of 
      parent container.

    - composition:hover .composition__photo:not(:hover)
      Trying to scale down the images near to image that is being hovered and 
      scaling up. In these types of problems always remember that there we will 
      most of the time need use of parent container.
