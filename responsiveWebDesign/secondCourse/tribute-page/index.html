            Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February
            24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali. His
            cousin, Bassma Al Jandaly, maintains that his birth name was Abdul
            Lateef Jandali. He was adopted by Clara (n√©e Hagopian) and Paul
            Reinhold Jobs.

          <p class="para">
            Schieble became pregnant with Jobs in 1954, when she and Jandali
            spent the summer with his family in Homs. According to Jandali,
            Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: "Without
            telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have
            the baby without anyone knowing, including me." Schieble gave birth
            to Jobs in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, and chose an adoptive
            couple for him that was "Catholic, well-educated, and wealthy", but
            the couple later changed their minds. He was then placed with Paul
            and Clara Jobs, who lacked wealth and college education, and
            Schieble refused to sign the adoption papers. She asked the court to
            find a different family, but consented when Paul and Clara pledged
            to fund his college education.

          <h3 class="subheading">Career</h3>
          <p class="para">
            The location of the Los Altos home meant that Jobs would be able to
            attend nearby Homestead High School, which had strong ties to
            Silicon Valley. He began his first year there in late 1968 along
            with Bill Fernandez, who introduced Jobs to Steve Wozniak, and would
            become Apple's first employee. Neither Jobs nor Fernandez (whose
            father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus
            decided to enroll in John McCollum's Electronics I class. Jobs had
            grown his hair long and become involved in the growing
            counterculture, and the rebellious youth eventually clashed with
            McCollum and lost interest in the class.

          <p class="para">
            In September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland,
            Oregon. He insisted on applying only to Reed, although it was an
            expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford.Jobs soon
            befriended Robert Friedland,who was Reed's student body president at
            that time. Brennan remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed.
            He later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented
            near the Reed campus, but she refused.

            By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I
            computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it;
            Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed. In
            April of that same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer
            Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.)
            as a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home on
            April 1, 1976. The operation originally started in Jobs's bedroom
            and later moved to the garage. Wayne stayed briefly, leaving Jobs
            and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company. The two
            decided on the name "Apple" after Jobs returned from the All One
            Farm commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time in the farm's
            apple orchard. Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed
            circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists
            for $50 (equivalent to about $240 in 2021) each. To fund the first
            batch, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs sold his
            Volkswagen van. Later that year, computer retailer Paul Terrell
            purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for $500 each. Eventually
            about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.

          <h3 class="subheading">Personal Life</h3>
          <p class="para">
            In 1989, Jobs first met his future wife, Laurene Powell, when he
            gave a lecture at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where
            she was a student. Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene "was
            right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't
            take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and
            started feeling a little giddy." After the lecture, he met her in
            the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point
            forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the
            rest of his life.

          <p class="para">
            Jobs proposed on New Year's Day 1990 with "a fistful of freshly
            picked wildflowers". They married on March 18, 1991, in a Buddhist
            ceremony at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. Fifty
            people, including Jobs's father, Paul, and his sister Mona,
            attended. The ceremony was conducted by Jobs's guru, Kobun Chino
            Otogawa. The vegan wedding cake was in the shape of Yosemite's Half
            Dome, and the wedding ended with a hike and Laurene's brothers'
            snowball fight. Jobs reportedly said to Mona: "You see, Mona [...],
            Laurene is descended from Joe Namath, and we're descended from John
            Muir." Jobs's and Powell's first child was born in 1991. Jobs's
            father, Paul, died a year and a half later, on March 5, 1993. Jobs's
            childhood home remains a tourist attraction and is currently owned
            by his stepmother (Paul's second wife), Marilyn Jobs
